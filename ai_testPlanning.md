## What is a Test Plan?

A test plan documents:
- **What** will be tested (scope)
- **Why** it will be tested (objectives)
- **How** it will be tested (approach)
- **When** it will be tested (timeline)
- **Who** will test it (resources)
- **Risk** and mitigation

## Customizing AI-Generated Test Plans

### Tailoring for Agile/Scrum

```text
Modify the test plan for Agile methodology:
- Convert to sprint-level test plan
- Add continuous testing checkpoints
- Include regression prioritization
- Add shift-left testing activities
- Define DoD (Definition of Done) from testing perspective
```

### Tailoring for Mobile Testing

```text
Adapt the test plan for mobile testing:
- Add device matrix (iOS 16+, Android 13+)
- Include orientation testing
- Add network condition testing (3G, 4G, offline)
- Include gesture and touch interactions
- Add battery and memory constraints
```

### Tailoring for API Testing

```text
Create an API-focused test plan:
- Define endpoint inventory
- Add request/response validation
- Include authentication flow testing
- Add rate limiting tests
- Define contract testing approach
- Include error handling scenarios
```

## Test Plan Review Checklist

Use AI to review your test plan:

```text
Review this test plan and:
1. Check for missing sections
2. Identify unrealistic timelines
3. Flag gaps in test coverage
4. Verify entry/exit criteria are measurable
5. Ensure risks have proper mitigation
6. Suggest improvements

[PASTE TEST PLAN]
```

## Anti-Hallucination Check

- [ ] All features in test plan match the actual requirements
- [ ] Timeline is realistic for your team size
- [ ] Tools mentioned are actually available in your environment
- [ ] Risk probabilities are based on real project context
- [ ] Do not copy AI output blindly — customize for your project

---

## Next Steps

- Define your [Test Strategy](ch_04_test_strategy_ai.md) based on the test plan
- Move to [AI-Generated Test Design](../ai_test_design/ch_04_ai_generated_test_design.md) for detailed test cases
- Use [Automation Code Generation](../automation_code_generation/ch_04_automation_code_generation.md) for Playwright scripts
